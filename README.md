## 🚀 What is YES AI Master Edition?

**YES AI Master Edition is not a chatbot.**

It is a **multi‑agent, multi‑brain, self‑healing, auto‑failover AI operating system** designed to think, recover, explain itself, and adapt in real‑time. Unlike traditional wrappers that crash when an API fails, YES AI is built to survive.

> **At its core, YES AI Master Edition is architected around Gemini 3 as its primary reasoning and orchestration engine.**

> ❝ One prompt in. A coordinated AI workforce out. ❞


> ## ⚡ Judge TL;DR (30-Second Overview)
>
> * 🧠 **Not a Chatbot** — A multi-agent AI operating system.
> * 🔄 **Self-Healing by Design** — Auto-retry & evaluator loops.
> * 🛡️ **Unbreakable AI** — Gemini-first reasoning with intelligent auto-failover (Llama → Qwen).
> * 🔮 **Unified Pipeline** — Chain Dev, Analyst, Creator & Sentinel modes.
> * 🧬 **Quantum-Ready** — Sentinel Mode generates Kyber-1024 safe keys.
> * 📊 **Glass-Box Observability** — Live "Brain View", Real-time Cost & Token tracking.

## 🔥 Core Philosophy (Why This Exists)

We moved beyond simple wrappers to build a resilient system.

| Traditional AI Wrappers ❌ | 🧠 YES AI Master Edition ✅ |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Single Model Dependency** | **Multi‑Brain Orchestration** (Gemini → Llama → Qwen) |
| **Silent Failures** (Crash on 429 / 5xx) | **Transparent Failover Logs** & Circuit Breakers |
| **Black‑box Output** | **Self‑Explaining Decisions** (Live "Brain View") |
| **Stateless / Forgetful** | **Consent-Based Memory** & Context Awareness |
| **Fragile Execution** | **Self‑Healing + Auto‑Retry Loops** |

## 🛡️ The "Unbreakable" Logic: Auto‑Failover Intelligence

Most AI tools stop working when they hit an API Quota error. **YES Ai gets smarter.**
*Gemini 3 remains the system’s cognitive core; failover models exist solely to preserve continuity, not to replace intelligence depth.*

### 💡 The Real-World Scenario
**🚫 The Old Way:**
> *User is working on a critical demo.*
> **AI:** "Error 429: Resource has been exhausted."
> **Result:** ❌ **CRASH.** The demo fails, and the user is stuck.

**✅ The YES Ai Way:**
> *User is working on the same demo.*
> **Gemini 3 Pro:** "Error 429: Quota Exceeded."
> **YES Ai Brain:** ⚠️ *"Primary Brain failed. Engaging Backup Circuit."*
> **Llama 3 (Groq):** *"I have taken over the request. Processing..."*
> **Result:** 🚀 **SUCCESS.** The user never noticed the failure.

### 🧠 How the Circuit Breaker Works
* **Primary Brain:** 🟢 `Gemini 3 Pro` (Planning, Reasoning, Reflection)
* **Continuity Brain:** 🟡 `Llama 3 on Groq` (Low-latency failover)
* **Survival Brain:** 🔴 `Qwen / Phi` (Emergency Fallback)

**Logic:** If Gemini fails repeatedly, the system triggers the **Circuit Breaker**, silently disabling the faulty model and routing all traffic to Llama 3. **Zero user interruption.**


## 🧬 High-Level Architecture

The system uses a **Universal Brain Router** to ensure 100% uptime.

* **Self-Repair:** Includes an **Auto-Debug Loop** to identify and patch logic errors before output. 🛠️
* **Validation:** Auto-appends `Dockerfile` for immediate deployment.
* **X-Factor:** Produces **Production-Ready Code**, not just snippets.

### 🎨 CREATOR MODE (Neon Pink Theme)
* **Role:** Viral Content Strategist.
* **Capabilities:** Writes engaging blogs, scripts, and posts.
* **Validation:** Auto-generates a **Social Media Pack** (Captions + 30 Viral Hashtags).
* **X-Factor:** Ready to copy-paste directly to LinkedIn/YouTube.

### 📊 ANALYST MODE (Deep Cyan Theme)
* **Role:** Lead Researcher & Data Scientist.
* **Capabilities:** Performs **Live Web Search** via SERPAPI.

## 🔮 Unified Pipeline Engine

Don't just stop at one task. YES Ai Master Edition allows **Cross-Mode Chaining**, effectively creating an autonomous assembly line where agents pass work to each other.

### 🔗 The "Neuro-Link" Workflow
The system allows output from one mode to be instantly piped into another for refinement, analysis, or publication.

## 📊 Real-Time Observability & Mission Metrics

Unlike black-box agents, YES Ai provides **Enterprise-Grade Transparency**. We track every millisecond and every cent.

<div align="center">
  <img src="mission.png" alt="Mission Metrics & Artifacts" width="35%" />
  <br>
  <em>(Screenshot: Live dashboard showing Token usage, Cost estimation, and Latency)</em>
</div>

### 🚀 Key Metrics Tracked:
* **📉 Cost Approximation:** Calculates session cost in real-time (e.g., `$0.000246`) based on input/output token logic.
* **⚡ Latency Monitor:** Tracks response time to ensure the Circuit Breaker isn't adding overhead.
* **🔢 Token Counter:** Live tracking of context window usage to prevent overflow.

---

## 📦 Instant Sandbox & Artifacts (The "Trust" Layer)

We don't just generate code; we provide the environment to run it.

<div align="center">
  <img src="sandbox.png" alt="Mission Metrics & Artifacts" width="50%" />
  <br>
</div>

* **🚀 Open Sandbox (Google Colab):** One-click button to instantly launch generated code in a secure cloud environment. No local setup needed.
* **🐳 Docker Ready:** Every "Dev Mode" and "Sentinel Mode" output includes a `Dockerfile` for immediate containerization.
* **💾 Persistent Session:** Data survives browser refreshes (Session State Management).

## 🛠️ Installation & Setup For Judges & Reviewers (Optional: Run Locally)

*Note: The Judges can test the system directly via the **Live Demo Link** above. This section is for technical verification only.*

1.  **Clone & Install**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/ranajit-dhar/yes-ai-master.git](https://github.com/ranajit-dhar/yes-ai-master.git)
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2.  **Environment Setup (Architecture Requirement)**
    The system requires a Multi-Model backend. If running locally, you need a `.env` file with:
    * `GOOGLE_API_KEY` (Primary Brain)
    * `GROQ_API_KEY` (Failover Brain)

3.  **Run**
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```
